  <h1>What Is Python?</h1>

  <p>
    Python is one of the most powerful and beginner-friendly programming languages in the world. 
    It is used to build websites, create video games, power artificial intelligence, and even help 
    scientists explore space.
  </p>

  <h2>The Creation of Python</h2>

  <p>
    Python was created in 1989 by <strong>Guido van Rossum</strong>, a Dutch computer programmer. 
    At the time, many programming languages were difficult to read and use. Guido wanted to create 
    something simple, clean, and powerful. He started developing Python as a side project during 
    his holiday break and officially released it in 1991.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Is It Called "Python"?</h2>

  <p>
    Python is not named after the snake. Guido van Rossum named it after the British comedy show 
    <strong>Monty Python's Flying Circus</strong>. He wanted a short, unique, and fun name, which 
    reflected the playful spirit of the language. Many example codes still include humor today.
  </p>

  <h2>Mini Story Boxes</h2>

  <div class="story-box">
    <h3>The First "Hello, World!"</h3>
    <p>
      One of the first things programmers learn is how to display a message on the screen. The tradition 
      of "Hello, World!" started in the 1970s and became popular after computer scientist 
      <strong>Brian Kernighan</strong> included it in his programming books. It is simple, clear, and 
      shows that a program works.
    </p>
    <pre>print("Hello, world!")</pre>
  </div>

  <div class="story-box">
    <h3>The "Bug" That Started It All</h3>
    <p>
      The term "bug" became famous in 1947 when computer scientist <strong>Grace Hopper</strong> and 
      her team found a moth trapped inside the Harvard Mark II computer. They taped the moth into the 
      logbook and wrote: "First actual case of bug being found." Today, debugging in Python continues 
      this problem-solving tradition.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="story-box">
    <h3>Python Almost Had a Different Future</h3>
    <p>
      In its early days, Python wasn’t instantly popular. It grew slowly through a community of 
      programmers who loved its simplicity. Making Python open-source allowed anyone to use, improve, 
      and share it for free, helping it become one of the most widely used programming languages today. 
      Companies like <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Netflix</strong>, and <strong>NASA</strong> 
      rely on Python every day.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Why Python Is Great for Beginners</h2>

  <p>
    Python reads almost like English, making it accessible to beginners. Unlike other programming languages 
    full of symbols and punctuation, Python is clear, logical, and easy to follow.
  </p>

  <pre>print("Hello, Maine!")</pre>

  <h2>What Python Is Used For</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Web development</li>
    <li>Artificial intelligence and machine learning</li>
    <li>Data science and analytics</li>
    <li>Automation</li>
    <li>Game development</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Python is versatile and widely used in real-world applications. Learning it teaches logical thinking, 
    problem-solving skills, and creativity. At Code For ME, we use Python to help students gain these skills 
    and prepare for future careers in technology.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Python Matters for the Future</h2>

  <p>
    From artificial intelligence to cybersecurity to environmental science, Python is shaping the modern world. 
    By learning Python, students are not just learning to code—they are learning to think, create, and lead. 
    At Code For ME, Python is often the first step on this exciting journey.
