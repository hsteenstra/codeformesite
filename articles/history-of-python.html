    <h1>The History of Python</h1>
    <h3>Discover the story behind the world’s favorite beginner-friendly programming language</h3>

    <h2>Before Python: The State of Coding in the 1980s</h2>
    <p>Before Python, programming was often complex and not very beginner-friendly. Popular languages in the 1980s included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fortran:</strong> Mainly for scientific and engineering calculations.</li>
      <li><strong>C:</strong> Powerful, low-level, but tricky for beginners.</li>
      <li><strong>COBOL:</strong> Used for business applications, very verbose.</li>
      <li><strong>Basic:</strong> Simple for small programs, often used in schools.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Writing code back then often required remembering strict syntax rules and spending a lot of time debugging errors. Computers were slower, and programming environments weren’t as user-friendly as today’s IDEs (Integrated Development Environments).</p>

    <div class="fun-fact">💾 Fun Fact: In the 1980s, many programmers actually punched their code into <strong>punch cards</strong> or typed it into very basic text editors!</div>

    <h2>The Birth of Python</h2>
    <p>In December 1989, <strong>Guido van Rossum</strong> began working on a new programming language during his time at <em>CWI (Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica)</em> in the Netherlands. He wanted a language that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Was easy to read and write.</li>
      <li>Had clear and simple syntax.</li>
      <li>Could be used for a variety of tasks, from small scripts to larger software projects.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Python was officially released in 1991. It quickly gained attention because it combined simplicity with power, allowing beginners and experienced programmers alike to write effective code without frustration.</p>

    <h2>About the Founder</h2>
    <div class="profile-box">
      <p><strong>Guido van Rossum</strong> is often called the “Benevolent Dictator For Life” (BDFL) of Python. Born in 1956 in the Netherlands, he worked on programming languages and software development for decades. His vision for Python was to create a language that emphasized readability and simplicity, making coding more approachable for everyone.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Python’s Evolution</h2>
    <p>Python has undergone major updates since its creation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Python 2 (2000):</strong> Introduced many features but eventually phased out due to incompatibilities.</li>
      <li><strong>Python 3 (2008):</strong> Modernized the language with better Unicode support, cleaner syntax, and improvements in standard libraries.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Today, Python is used in web development, data science, AI, education, and more. Its simplicity allows beginners to learn coding quickly, while experts use it to create complex applications.</p>

    <div class="fun-fact">💡 Fun Fact: Python has its own mascot: a cute cartoon snake named “Python”! 🐍</div>

    <h2>Why Python Matters</h2>
    <p>Python’s design philosophy, “readability counts,” made programming more accessible. It sparked a new era where learning to code was not just for experts. Python tutorials, beginner courses, and community projects continue to make it one of the most popular languages in the world.</p>

    <div class="fun-fact">✨ Fun Fact: Python is so versatile that it can be used for games, websites, robots, AI, and even music! 🎵</div>
