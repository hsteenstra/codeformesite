    <h1>The History of Python</h1>
    <h3>Discover the story behind the programming language that changed coding for beginners and professionals alike</h3>

    <h2>Before Python: Coding in the 1980s</h2>
    <p>Programming before Python was often strict and unforgiving. Languages like Fortran, COBOL, C, and Basic were widely used, each with their challenges. Developers needed to carefully follow syntax rules, debug manually, and often work with slow computers.</p>
    <div class="fun-fact">Many programmers in the 1980s used punch cards or simple text editors. Debugging could take hours for small mistakes.</div>
    <div class="clear"></div>

    <h2>The Birth of Python</h2>
    <p>In December 1989, Guido van Rossum started working on a new language at CWI in the Netherlands. His goal was to create a language that was easy to read, versatile, and could be used for small scripts or large projects alike. Python was officially released in 1991 and immediately gained attention for its simplicity and readability.</p>
    <div class="fun-fact">Python’s name comes from the comedy show Monty Python’s Flying Circus, not the snake.</div>
    <div class="clear"></div>

    <h2>About the Founder</h2>
    <div class="profile-box">
      <p><strong>Guido van Rossum</strong>, born in 1956 in the Netherlands, worked on programming languages and software development for decades. He is often referred to as Python’s “Benevolent Dictator for Life.” His vision emphasized readability, simplicity, and making coding accessible to everyone.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Python’s Evolution</h2>
    <p>Python has evolved through major versions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Python 2 (2000):</strong> Widely used, but eventually replaced due to incompatibilities.</li>
      <li><strong>Python 3 (2008):</strong> Modernized the language with better Unicode support, cleaner syntax, and more powerful libraries.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="fun-fact">Python can be used for web development, AI, data science, automation, and even creating games.</div>
    <div class="clear"></div>

    <h2>Why Python Matters</h2>
    <p>Python’s philosophy of “readability counts” has transformed programming. It allowed beginners to learn coding without frustration and enabled professionals to build complex applications efficiently. Today, Python remains one of the most popular languages worldwide.</p>
    <div class="fun-fact">Many online courses and tutorials use Python as the first programming language for beginners.</div>
