<h1>What Is Python?</h1>

<p>
Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It is used to build websites,
analyze data, power artificial intelligence, and automate tasks.
</p>

<h2>Why Python Is Great for Beginners</h2>

<p>
Python was designed to be simple and readable. Unlike many programming languages that look
complicated, Python uses clear and straightforward syntax that is easier to understand.
</p>

<pre>
print("Hello World")
</pre>

<p>
Even if you have never coded before, you can probably guess what that program does.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Web development</li>
<li>Artificial intelligence</li>
<li>Data science</li>
<li>Automation</li>
<li>Game development</li>
</ul>

<p>

for new programmers.
